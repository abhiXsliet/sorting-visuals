# Sorting Visualizer

## Overview

The Sorting Visualizer is a web application built using React.js and TypeScript that allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides an interactive interface for sorting a random array of numbers and observing the step-by-step process of how different sorting algorithms work.

## Features

- Visualize popular sorting algorithms, including Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and more.
- Adjustable array size and sorting speed to customize your visualizations.
- Step through the sorting process or watch the algorithm sort the array in real-time.
- Clear and intuitive user interface for easy interaction.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by forking and cloning the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhixsliet/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open in Your Browser:** Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the Sorting Visualizer in action.

## How to Use

1. Click on a sorting algorithm from the navbar.
2. Adjust the array size using the slider.
3. Set the sorting speed (in milliseconds per step) using the slider.
4. Click the "Sort" button to start the selected sorting algorithm.
5. Observe the bars in the array container as they move and swap positions during sorting.
